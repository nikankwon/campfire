                <h3>We all have a yearning...</h3>

                <h5>Have you found the elusive truth that lurks in-between the lines of veiled layers of society?</h5>

                <h6>The point man. The maverick. The rebel. The Truthseers.</h6>

                <p>Life is a path stricken in a never-ending war where the odds are stacked against you; karma continues to chase you down this path, unrelenting, jealous, and ubiquitously stubborn.</p>

                <p>In this modern era dominated by consumerism, capitalism, and seemingly nihilistic momentous movements of the populous that provide no room for self-reflections and peaceful solitudes to recollect all that we've gone through, there's the inevitable fatigue that we accrue from the grinding of the cogwheels of mental and physical labor.</p>

                <p>Those who either bought themselves into the system, indoctrinated to the point of no return, or slothful to awaken to the maverick depths of various truths that the human core constantly longs for - they are fools of an artificial kind, forever in denial when the option to unplug is right in front of their eyes.</p>

                <p>We are truth seekers but we are also empathizers of the highest virtues of humanity. We are here to tell, with subjectivity but with the deepest depths of our soul laid bare to color the context. </p>

                <p>We are here to listen, being the arbitors of mercy, sympathy, and genuine kindness that so many religious prophets have decreed as requirements for transcendence.</p> 

                <p>We are strangers to one another, and yet, eternal friends of many lifetimes, sometimes overlapped, sometimes spanning centuries.</p>
                
                <p>There's stories to be told, lessons to be learned, tears to be shed, laughters to be yelled, silences to be momented.</p>
                
                <p>Sit down, my friend of all times present,</p>
                
                <p>Let your heart and mind laid bare, for we are all naked here in darkness.</p>
